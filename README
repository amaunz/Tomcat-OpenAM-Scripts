1. Clone this to ~/bin (unfortunate naming, will clash with existing dir)
2. Add a file 'config.cfg' to bin. Insert key-value pairs there. Keys are:

OPENAM_ADMIN        # OPENAM admin id
OPENAM_ADMIN_PW     # 
OPENAM_SVC_PW       # Encrypt pw for passwords in backups
OPENAM_PASSWD_PATH  # this file needs to be chmod 400 and contain only $OPENAM_ADMIN_PW
NAIL_USER           # Automated mailing user
NAIL_USER_PW        #
PREF                # SSH prefix for remote machine: 'user@host'
LDAP_USER           # OPENAM LDAP USER
LDAP_USER_PWD       #
LDAP_USER_MAIL      #
